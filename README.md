# temperature-alert

This is my first program! :)
It's a personal project. It checks if today's hourly temperatures are above or below a given temperature. You can run it in the console. If you prefer, an email with the retrieved data can be sent to the specified recipients; in this case, you need a Google account.

## Why & How:

:turtle: My tortoise lives in the garden and needs shelter when the temperatures are below 4°C. He always acts like a tough guy who doesn't need protection, but he does indeed. If the weather is cold, I put him in his house - if he's not already there.

Before learning Python, I had to check the weather manually every day. After learning Python, I automated this process by making a simple app that checks daily if and when the temperatures in my city are below 4°C and sends me an email.

A couple of weeks later, I thought that maybe some other people have a similar need. So, I began expanding the idea behind the app to make it customizable. That's how "temperature-alert" was born.

To make this app I used Python with a dash of HTML and CSS.


## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash

 pip install requirements.txt
 ```

## Usage
(currently working on this section, sorry!)

## Lessons Learned
I learned a lot thanks to this project!
In general:
- Before writing code: have a precise idea of what the project will be, its purpose, and its usage.
- When writing code: organize the code into small units and always choose "simple and clear" over "concise and cryptic". Refactor the code when possible. Test the code and write docstrings while developing.
- After writing the code: write the docs.

Specifically, I learned the basics of how to:
- Send emails
- Use jinja2, pytest and unittest
- Test the code
- Write the docs
