# temperature-alert

## About
Hi! I'm currently working on my first project. 

<p>This app checks if today's temperatures are above or below a given temperature. You can run it in the console. If you prefer, an email with the retrieved data can be sent to the specified recipients; in this case you need a Google account.</p>
